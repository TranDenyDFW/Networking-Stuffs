 - Default Hello Timer: 3 seconds

HSRP STATES
 - Disabled – HSRP is not running.
 - Init – Router is waiting for HSRP to start.
 - Listen – Router listens for HSRP hello messages.
 - Speak – Router actively participates in the election.
 - Standby – Backup router, ready to take over if the active router fails.

PRIORITY VALUES
 - Determines which router becomes the Active router.
 - Default is 100, but a higher priority wins.
 - If preemption is enabled, a router with a higher priority can take over when it recovers.
VIRTUAL IP ADDRESSES
 - HSRP assigns a virtual IP that client devices use as their default gateway.
 - The Active router owns this IP, and the Standby router takes over if the Active fails.
